# Eloquent JavaScript âš¡
This is just a collection of simple projects I made when I was reading this book called [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net). I have not finished it as I haven't gotten the theim too. Been busy with other larger projects. It was a good book though, it might be of some help to you

## Getting Started
First fork and clone the repo. Make sure you have ```node js```. Then, choose a project you want to try out and run this:
```
node <file_name>
```
